# WhatToMakeApp
Find different recipes to make with ingredients you have at home.

What To Make allows you to find recipes based on ingredients you have at home. A recipe will be suggested if you have all the ingredients required by the recipe at home in your “fridge”. What To Make has 4 screens including a “home page” where you can find recipes to make and add your own recipes to the database. The “fridge” contains all the ingredients you have at home. The “shopping list” contains ingredients you will need to buy to cook a desired recipe. The final screen contains a database of all the preloaded recipes in the What To Make App as well as the custom recipes created by the user. By selecting a preloaded recipe you are able to see what ingredients you have and what ingredients you will need to add to you shopping list to cook that recipe.
